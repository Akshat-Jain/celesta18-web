<h4>Objective</h4>

Objective of this event is to find the solution to the following problems or give detailed information about the solution other countries have.<br>
<ol>
<li>Reuse of water</li>
<li>Internet and mobile technology to all</li>
<li>Using garbage to solve some other problem.</li>
<li>Open topic.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Problem Statement</h4>
<ol>
Your team need to present an idea of a working model with PPT or a physical model to solve any of the following problem :-
<li>It has been presumed by many that third world war will happen due to the outsourcing of water. We will for sure need a plan in future to reuse the wastewater more effectively since we are not right now.</li>
<li>Though government is providing many apps and data over internet  to help farmers on having a better yield. It has been seen that plenty of farmers are not able to take full benefit from the schemes primarily due to the lack of internet or mobile technology. Google and Facebook are also trying hard to provide internet to all.</li>
<li>Scotland have found a way to convert their garbage into usable energy. It is so effect that they are now importing garbage from their neighbour countries. We (Indians), on the other hand, are suffering to implement Swachh Bharat Abhiyan and at the same time are not able to fulfill our energy problems.</li>
