<h4>Aim:</h4>

The objective is to construct a wired or a wireless, manually controlled bot that can attack, immobilize or throw out the opponent's bot in one on one competition.

<h4>Team Specification:</h4>

A team can consist of maximum of <strong>4 participants</strong>. Every team should have a unique name.

<h4>Arena:</h4>

<img style="" src='./images/poster/events/arenarobo.jpg'>

<h4>Bot Specifications:</h4><ul>

<li> The dimensions of the bot should not be exceeding <strong>(50cm)*(50cm)*(50cm)</strong>.</li>

<li> The weight of the bot <strong>should not exceed 15 kg</strong>, including all hydraulics and on-board circuits, etc.</li></ul>

<h4>Mobility:</h4>

<li> Rolling (wheels, tracks , castor wheels, etc.) or Walking using linear actuated legs are <strong>ALLOWED</strong>.</li>

<strong><h4>Control requirements:</h4></strong>

<h4>For wired machines:</h4><ul>

<li> The teams which are using wired controlled bot must have adapter as per their requirement <strong>but not exceeding 36V DC</strong> acroos any two terminals.</li>

For wireless machines:

<li> The teams must have at least four channel wireless remote control circuit or two dual control circuits which may be interchanged before the start of match to avoid frequency</li>

interference with other teams. The case of any interference in the wireless systems will not be considered for rematch.

<li> Remote control systems from readymade toys should not be used.</li></ul>

<h4>Power Source:</h4><ul>

<li> The electric voltage between 2 points anywhere in the machine should not be more than <strong>36V DC</strong> at any point of time.</li>

<li> No AC source should be used at any point on the bot.</li></ul>

<h4>For Wireless bots:</h4><ul>

<li> All efforts must be made to <strong>protect battery terminals</strong> from a direct short and causing a battery fire, failure to do so will cause direct disqualification.</li>

<li> Battery will not be allowed to change during the match.</li></ul>

<h4>Weapons:</h4><ul>

<li><h4>Allowed:</h4><ul>

<li> Cutters, blades, saws and spinning hammers(wire cutting is allowed) , Magnetic weapons, flippers, lifting devices.</li>

<li> Hydraulics can be used for lifting purposes with entire hydraulic setup should be on-board, no external input (from outside the arena) can be given to the robot for functioning of its hydraulic system.</li></ul></li><li>

<h4>Not Allowed:</h4><ul>

<li> Any kind of inflammable/corrosive fluid, Liquid projectiles, Flame based weapons. Any kind of explosive or intentionally ignited solid or potentially ignitable solid.</li>

<li> Nets, tape, glue, or any other entanglement device.</li>

<li> Radio jamming, tazers , tesla coils, or any other high-voltage device.</li></ul></li></ul>

<h4>Gameplay:</h4><ul>

<li> Tournament will be in the form of league which will lead to semi-finals and finals.</li>

<li> Fixtures and duration of each match will be decided on the spot depending on number of teams and time constraints.</li>

<li> Point allocation will not be disclosed leading to any disputes but it is assured that point allocation will be fair and without any discrimination.</li></ul>

<h4>Criteria for victory:</h4><ul>

<li> A bot is declared victorious in that particular match if its opponent is immobilized and the match will be finished at that point of time.</li>

<li> A bot is declared immobilized if it cannot display any kind of linear motion of one inch for a time period of 30 seconds. A bot with one side of its drive train disabled will not be counted out if it can demonstrate some degree of controlled movement. In case both the robots remain mobile after the end of the round then the winner will be decided subjectively.</li>

<li> If a robot is thrown out of the arena that particular match will stop immediately, and the robot still inside the arena will automatically be declared as the winner for that match.</li>

<li> Robots cannot win by pinning or lifting their opponents. Organizers will allow pinning or lifting for a maximum of 25 seconds per pin/lift then the attacker robot will be instructed to release the

opponent, If, after being instructed to do so, the attacker bot is not able to release its opponent, their robot may be disqualified.</li>

<li> If two or more robots become entangled or a crushing or gripping weapon is employed and becomes trapped within another robot, then the competitors should make the timekeeper aware, the fight should be stopped and the robots separated by the safest means.</li>

<li> Points will be given on the basis of aggression, damage, control and strategy.</li>

<li> If a bot is deemed unsafe by the judges or if it damages arena in any form, it will be immediately disqualified. The match will be immediately halted and opponent will be declared winner.</li>

<li> Qualification of a bot to next level is subjective and totally on the decision of the judges. A bot winning in a round against its opponent doesnï¿½t guarantee its entrance into the next round. If the judges found the winner bot incompetent to enter into the next round, it may get disqualified. Judges can disqualify both the bots of a match from advancing to the next round. All the decisions taken by the judges will be final and binding to all. Any queries afterwards will not be entertained.</li></ul>

<h4>Safety Rules:</h4>

<ul>

<li> Special care should be taken to protect the on-board batteries, bot without proper protection will not be allowed to compete.</li>

<li> If you have a bot or weapon design that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in some way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizers. Safe </li>

innovation is always encouraged, but surprising the organizers with your brilliant exploitation of a loophole may cause your robot to be disqualified before it even competes.

<li> All weapons must have a safety cover on any sharp edges.</li>

<li> Any kind of activity (repairing, battery handling, etc.) which may cause damage to the surroundings during the stay of the teams in the competition area should not be carried out without  consent of organizers. Not following this rule may result in disqualification.</li>
