<h4>DE-CODE</h4>

<h4>Introduction</h4>
If you are crazy about small controlling objects and believe that you can make the best of it.<br>
If you can’t resist to know that how these small objects perform  big tasks.<br>
If you think your intelligence gets forward biased every time an electronic circuit is induced to you then this is the event for you.<br>

Then this event is for you only.<br>

<h4>Rules</h4>
It’s a three members team event, but one can participate alone too.<br>
The result will be declared on the spot.<br>
3 hours  time limit.<br>
<h4>Round 0 (Set yourself)</h4>
A question paper will be provided with multiple choice question.<br>
Each question has some virtual money which will be given only if your answer is correct.<br>
No elimination based on MCQ <br>
<h4>Round 1 (Decoding the circuit)</h4>
A question will be given. You have to decode 3 circuits from the 3 problem set. <br>
If you can decode it then the you can buy required components from your virtual money. Each component has a different cost.<br>
If you can’t decode the circuit, such will be provided to you deducing fixed amount of virtual money.<br>
Virtual money will be used to buy the components.<br>
If a team is short of virtual money, they will have to mortgage virtual money.<br>
<h4>Round 2 (Circuit Designing)</h4>
You have to design all 3 circuits.<br>
Successful implementation of circuit will give virtual money.<br>

<h4>Round 3 (Debug me)</h4>
A problem statement with an in-built circuit will be given to you.<br>
That circuit will have some fault . You have to debug the circuit and make it work.<br>
 
<h4>Judging Criteria</h4>
Team  having the largest virtual amount at the end will win. But they will have to complete all their tasks.<br>
One must complete each round to proceed to next round.<br>
