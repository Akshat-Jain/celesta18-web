<h4>Aim:</h4>
Two ocellaris clownfish, Marlin and his wife Coral, admire their new home in the Great Barrier Reef and their<br/>
clutch of eggs when a barracuda attacks. All the eggs have been eaten by the barracuda. Marlin names this last<br/>
egg NEMO, a name that Coral liked.<br/>
<br/>
Nemo develops a smaller right fin as a result of damage to his egg during the attack, which limits his<br/>
swimming ability. Worried about Nemo's safety, Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a school field trip. Nemo<br/>
sneaks away from the reef and is captured by scuba divers.<br/>
<br/>
While attempting to save Nemo, Marlin meets YOU, now only you can save NEMO by finding correct path by<br/>
your amazing eyes, so here is you're CHALLENGE<br/>
<br/>
You have to make an autonomous bot which will decide its path using image processing and it would finally<br/>
find NEMO.<br/>

<h4>Team Specification:</h4>
A team can consist of maximum of <strong>4 participants</strong>. Every team should have a unique name.

<h4>Bot Specifications:</h4>
<ul>
<li>The dimensions of the bot should not be exceeding <strong>(50cm)*(50cm)*(50cm)</strong>.</li>
<li>The weight of the bot <strong>should not exceed 20 kg</strong>, including all batteries, laptop sensors, and on-board<br/>
circuits, etc.</li>
<li>The bot must be autonomous.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rules:</h4>
<ul>
<li>You can use your mobile and laptop as well but you can't change command after you have started<br/>
your journey i.e. after the bot is started.</li>

<li>The bot should take real time images and act accordingly.</li>

<li>It has to identify colors and depending on color orientation it has to decide its path. Always bot has to<br/>
turn in the direction of <strong>green color</strong>. Say <strong>green</strong> is on left and <strong>red</strong> is on right then it has to turn left side.</li>

<li>The balls which we are going to use in the competition will be given to the competitors few days <br/>
before the competition. And distance from the ball at which the bot has to make the turn also will be <br/>
told to them.</li>

<li>After taking correct paths it has to finally reach NEMO and then by identifying a different<br/>
color(NEMO) <strong>blue</strong>, a song must be played depending on your choice like "KOI MIL GAYA".</li>

<li>Every team will be given <strong>maximum 3 chances</strong>.</li>

<li>For every wrong turn penalty will be given.</li>

</ul>

<h4>Arena:</h4>
This is the sample arena it will be changed during the competition to avoid discrepancies.<br/>

<h4>Scoring Criteria:</h4>
<ul>
<li>For every correct turn 30 points will be awarded and for every wrong turn a penalty of 10<br/>
points will be given.</li>
<li>For finding Nemo 50 points will be awarded and after the song is played 20 more points <br/>
will be awarded.</li>
<li>In case of tie timing will be considered the tie breaking factor.</li>
<li>In case of any discrepancies the organizer's decision would be the final decision.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Safety Rules:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Special care should be taken to protect the on-board batteries; bot without proper protection<br/>
will not be allowed to compete.</li>
<li>If you have a bot that does not fit within the categories set forth in these rules or is in some<br/>
way ambiguous or borderline, please contact the event organizers.</li>
<li>Safe innovation is always encouraged, but surprising the organizers with your brilliant <br/>
exploitation of a loophole may cause your robot to be disqualified before it even competes.</li>
</ul>
