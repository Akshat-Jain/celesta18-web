 
<h4>Problem Statement</h4><ol>
<li>You need to make a battery powered launching device(Fire gun).  </li>	
    <li>   You also need to convert a simple plastic bottle into a rocket which can be fired through   </li>
    <li>       the gun into the sky reaching weapon of mass destruction.</li></ol>

<h4>Working Principle</h4><ol>
    <li><h4> For Rocket:</h4>
        The plastic bottle is filled with alcohol vapour and secured on the Fire gun. It blasts off as    
         soon as an electric spark is produced by Fire gun.
        ( Cheat Codes : For better control of the range of rocket, the concepts of Centre of Mass  
         -Centre of Pressure should be applied while making the rocket. )</li>
    <li><h4> For Fire gun:</h4>
         It should look like a gun made of anything like plastic. It should have long nozzle 
         approximately  1 feet (0.30m) (for safety purpose).  As soon as you plug the trigger of the 
         gun, the spark is generated inside the bottle which is fitted on the nozzle of the gun. This 
         will lead to blast off the rocket.</li></ol>

<h4>Rules</h4><ol>
     <li> A team can have at most 2 members.</li>
    <li>  Each team needs to bring a modified bottle rocket and Fire gun with them. The alcohol will  </li>
          be provided.
    <li> Inner diameter of mouth of the bottle should be slightly greater than the nozzle.</li></ol>

<h4>Judging Criteria</h4>
Judging will be based on the followings:<br><ol>
<li>Each team must submit about 100 words text explaining their Fire gun and rocket design. </li>
   <li>       You can also add the image of your rocket .The last date for submission is 21 October by 
          5 pm. Send your responses in a MS Word file at vijay.ch15@iitp.ac.in  (10 points)</li>
    <li>  The appearance of gun and rocket  . (10 points each)</li>
   <li>   The rockets will be shot and the range will be measured .The range will be measured for 
         only those rockets whose range exceeds a minimum distance, provided at the beginning 
          of this round. The rocket having the maximum range will be the winner. (70 points)
